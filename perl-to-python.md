The provided Perl code appears to be creating a hash reference (`$w`) and initializing it with a combination of data from another hash reference (`$a->{b}`) and additional key-value pairs.

Let's break down the code:

```perl
$w = { %($a->{b}), gl => { doc => [["w" => "$abc/path"]], imp => [] } };
```

1. `$w`: This is the variable being assigned. It is a reference to a hash. In Perl, `{}` is used to create an anonymous hash reference.

2. `%($a->{b})`: This part involves copying the key-value pairs from the hash reference `$a->{b}` into the new hash referenced by `$w`. The `%{...}` syntax is used to dereference the hash. The `%` symbol is used to copy the elements from one hash to another.

3. `,`: This comma separates the copied key-value pairs from the additional key-value pairs that will be added to the hash.

4. `gl => { doc => [["w" => "$abc/path"]], imp => [] }`: This part adds a new key-value pair to the hash. The key is "gl", and its associated value is another hash reference. This nested hash has two keys: "doc" and "imp".

   - `"doc" => [["w" => "$abc/path"]]`: This key-value pair associates the key "doc" with an array reference containing a single element, which is itself an array reference. This innermost array reference contains two elements, "w" and "$abc/path".

   - `"imp" => []`: This key-value pair associates the key "imp" with an empty array reference.

In summary, the code creates a new hash reference `$w` by combining the key-value pairs from `$a->{b}` with additional key-value pairs under the key "gl". The resulting structure is a nested hash containing information copied from `$a->{b}` and new data under the "gl" key.

### vs

Here's the equivalent Python code for the given Perl code:

```python
w = {**a['b'], 'gl': {'doc': [['w', f'{abc}/path']], 'imp': []}}
```

In Python, you can use the `{**dict1, **dict2}` syntax to merge dictionaries. This is used to combine the key-value pairs from `a['b']` into a new dictionary referenced by `w`. The additional key-value pairs are then added for the "gl" key, creating the nested structure similar to the Perl code. Note that in Python, f-strings are used for string interpolation, and `{abc}` is assumed to be a variable containing the value of `$abc` in the Perl code.
