# exploratory data analysis

```python
df.isna().sum(); 
```
The code you provided appears to be written in Python and is using the pandas library. 
It is calling the `isna()` method on an `DataFrame` object named df and then calculating the sum of missing values for each column.

The `isna()` method in pandas returns a boolean mask indicating whether each element in the DataFrame is missing or not. 
The sum() function is then used to calculate the sum of True values for each column, as True represents a missing value.
To execute this code, you need to have the pandas library installed and a DataFrame object named df defined. 
You can replace df with the name of your actual DataFrame.
