The code you provided is defining a new method `exists?` for the File class in Ruby, while preserving the original behavior of the `exists?` method by aliasing it as `_exists?`.
`class << File`: This syntax opens up the singleton class (also known as the eigenclass or metaclass) of the File class. It allows defining methods specific to the singleton class of File, which affects only the File class itself, not its instances.

`alias :_exists? :exists?`: This line creates an alias for the existing method `exists?` of the File class. It renames the original `exists?` method as `_exists?`. This aliasing ensures that the original behavior of `exists?` is preserved.

`def File.exists?(arg)`: This line defines a new method `exists?` within the singleton class of File. The method takes an argument arg.

`_exists? arg or symlink? arg`: Inside the newly defined `exists?` method, it calls the aliased `_exists?` method with the provided argument `arg`. The `or` operator is used to add additional behavior. If the original `_exists?` method returns `false` (indicating the file does not exist), it calls the `symlink?` method with the same argument `arg`. The `symlink?` method is a built-in Ruby method that checks if a file is a symbolic link.

By defining the `File.exists?` method in this way, it overrides the default behavior of `File.exists?` and adds an extra condition to also check if the file is a symbolic link.
